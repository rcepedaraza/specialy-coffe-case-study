### Problem Statement:
Assert whether a potentially business-transformaing deal with a mysterioyrs coffee farm in China will take your business to the next level.

This notebook uses decision trees to determine whether the factors of salary, gender, age, how much money the customer spent last week and during the preceding month on RR Diner Coffee products, how many kilogram coffee bags the customer bought over the last year, whether they have bought at least one RR Diner Coffee product online, and their distance from the flagship store in the USA, could predict whether customers would purchase the Hidden Farm coffee if a deal with its farmers were struck.
